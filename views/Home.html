        <h2>Calibre Compatible</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/" target="_blank">Calibre</a> is a widely popular suite of tools for ebook reading and library management. However, it limits you to a desktop environment and doesn't enable you to easily access and modify your library from other devices. Since Calibre is such a popular program and still very useful for advanced library management we have made Libyq entirely compatible with Calibre libraries. You can upload your Calibre library to Libyq and if you ever need to, re-download the updated and still-Calibre-compatible library.
