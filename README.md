An abandoned all-in-one cloud-synced ebook reader, storage, and management system, which works in tandem with [http-calibre](https://github.com/MrXyfir/http-calibre) v4 and optionally [Xyfir-Books-PhoneGap](https://github.com/Xyfir/Xyfir-Books-PhoneGap).

# Abandoned

xyBooks turned into [xyReader](https://www.xyfir.com/reader), which is based on this code. This repository will likely not receive any more updates. There is no setup, configuration, or API documentation, so you'll have to look through the code itself. Some changes were made for this open source release that have _not_ been tested, meaning you may run into some minor runtime issues if you try to run this. You'll also need [http-calibre](https://github.com/MrXyfir/http-calibre) (v4 branch) for this to work, and it is referred to internally in the codebase as 'xyLibrary' or 'Xyfir Library' or even just 'library'.
